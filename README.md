# leechcode

Free leetcode

Every company requires to hire new candidates, and based on the recent trend, it is very clear the that the maximum hiring and firing takes place in the development field. The initial rounds for the hiring is always a coding round, and hence we try to create a leetcode which can be used by companies as thier own product. A platform where students can give coding tests owned by the companies.

The initial plan is to create the following.
An UI where
  - user reads a question on the left half of the page.
  - user has space to write code on the right half of the page
  - has a submit button to turn in his solution
  - test case result page
  - profile/score page

As the project develops
we plan to make the following
  - An admin panel to CRUD coding questions.
  - CRUD the test cases for a question
  - Create sharable test link to students with an expiry
  - user management (login)
  - user creation (creating user for students who have applied to companies)

The stack which is decided is
Angular for frontend
Mongodb for database
Go for backend
